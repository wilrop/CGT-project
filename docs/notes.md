# Notes

+ If we finished our code we can maybe run a different experiment with different parameters from the ones presented in the paper to potentially receive some new and interesting information.

+ Talk about the risk parameter, this is sometimes difficult to provide in a real-world application or problem.

+ The conclusion in the paper is that people will start to push the money units more at the end of the game since the risk of failure becomes higher in that stage of the game. It would be nice if we could find a way to investigate if in a real-world situation where everyone starts to take action at the end could lead to a failure since everyone is just postponing the deadline.

+ Maybe it is iteressting if we experiment with players that have different possibilties for the strategies for adding money to the pool, now you have the options 0,1,2 but maybe a player could add more or less.
